## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get PlexBot up and running on your server.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A Discord Bot application created on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plexbot.git
cd Plexbot
```

### 3. Setup
It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configuration
PlexBot uses two primary configuration files. Sample files are provided to get you started.

**A. Environment Variables (`.env`)**

Copy the sample file:
```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file and fill in your details. This file holds your secret keys and basic connection info. See the comments in the `sample.env` file for guidance on each variable.

**B. JSON Configuration (`config.json`)**

Copy the sample configuration:
```bash
cp config.json.sample config.json
```

Edit `config.json` to configure the bot's features, like enabling/disabling modules, setting up Sonarr instances, and mapping users.

### 5. Running the Bot
Once configured, you can start the bot with:
```bash
python bot.py
```

For a more robust setup, it is recommended to run the bot using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file after building the Docker image.
